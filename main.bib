@article{Fienberg2012,
	Abstract = { Networks are ubiquitous in science. They have also become a focal point for discussion in everyday life. Formal statistical models for the analysis of network data have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas of study, and most of these involve a form of graphical representation. Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with empirical studies in social psychology and sociology from the 1960s, these early works generated an active ``social science network community'' and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This effort moved into the statistical literature in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the past decade has seen a burgeoning network literature coming out of statistical physics and computer science. In particular, the growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence of online ``networking communities'' such as Facebook, Google+, MySpace, LinkedIn, and Twitter, and a host of more specialized professional network communities have intensified interest in the study of networks and network data. This article reviews some of these developments, introduces some relevant statistical models for static network settings, and briefly points to open challenges. },

	Abstract = {Abstract This article provides an introductory summary to the formulation and application of exponential random graph models for social networks. The possible ties among nodes of a network are regarded as random variables, and assumptions about dependencies among these random tie variables determine the general form of the exponential random graph model for the network. Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 81, 832--842] are not appropriate for many observed networks, whereas the new model specifications of Snijders et al.

	Abstract = {We live in a ``small world,'' where two arbitrary people are likely connected by a short chain of intermediate friends. With scant information about a target individual, people can successively forward a message along such a chain. Experimental studies have verified this property in real social networks, and theoretical models have been advanced to explain it. However, existing theoretical models have not been shown to capture behavior in real-world social networks. Here, we introduce a richer model relating geography and social-network friendship, in which the probability of befriending a particular person is inversely proportional to the number of closer people. In a large social network, we show that one-third of the friendships are independent of geography and the remainder exhibit the proposed relationship. Further, we prove analytically that short chains can be discovered in every network exhibiting the relationship.},

Drawing on contact theory, this study tests whether school organization affects friendship segregation in a national sample of adolescent friendship networks. The results show that friendship segregation peaks in moderately heterogeneous schools but declines at the highest heterogeneity levels. As suggested by contact theory, in schools where extracurricular activities are integrated, grades tightly bound friendship, and races mix within tracks, friendship segregation is less pronounced. The generally positive relation between heterogeneity and friendship segregation suggests that integration strategies built on concentrating minorities in large schools may accentuate friendship segregation. },

@article{Charles1995,
	Abstract = { This article introduces a structural approach to analyzing sex segregation data that rests on margin-free measures of the underlying association in sex-by-occupation arrays. The starting point for the analyses is a log-multiplicative model that is formally consistent with the conventional practice of summarizing cross-national variability in a single parameter pertaining to the overall strength of sex segregation. Under this baseline specification, the segregation regime is forced to take on the same basic shape in each country, with the only form of permissible variability being a uniform compression or expansion of the peaks and valleys characterizing the shared segregation profile. Although the latter model does not account for the cross-national variability in our illustrative data, it can be readily generalized in ways that both improve the fit and yield new insights into the structure and sources of sex segregation. These elaborated models can be used to examine the hierarchical structure of segregation, to identify the dominant "segregation profiles" in industrial countries, and to parse out the net residue of segregation at multiple levels of analysis. },

It relies on a unique feature of the American Housing Survey, whose 1985, 1989 and 1993 waves provide data for small residential neighborhoods. These consist of a dwelling unit and up to ten of its nearest neighbors. The paper employs several parametric and non-parametric econometric tools to measure income sorting in \{US\} residential neighborhoods. It documents the patterns of dependence among neighbors' income and imperfect sorting, with moderate but very significant correlation among incomes of neighbors and of considerable income mixing in \{US\} neighborhoods. These results persist even if choice-based sampling and heterogeneity across the sample are accounted for. Neighborhoods associated with a randomly selected renter are more sorted than those associated with an owner even though such owners are more likely to define their neighborhoods. },

@article{-Koehly2004,
	Abstract = { Much progress has been made on the development of statistical methods for network analysis in the past ten years, building on the general class of exponential family random graph (ERG) network models first introduced by Holland and Leinhardt (1981). Recent examples include models for Markov graphs, ``p*'' models, and actor-oriented models. For empirical application, these ERG models take a logistic form, and require the equivalent of a network census: data on all dyads within the network. In a largely separate stream of research, conditional log-linear (CLL) models have been adapted for analyzing locally sampled (``egocentric'') network data. While the general relation between log-linear and logistic models is well known and has been exploited in the case of a priori blockmodels for networks, the relation for the CLL models is different due to the treatment of absent ties. For fully saturated tie independence models, CLL and ERG are equivalent and related via Bayes' rule. For other tie independence models, the two do not yield equivalent predicted values, but we show that in practice the differences are unlikely to be large. The alternate conditioning in the two models sheds light on the relationship between local and complete network data, and the role that models can play in bridging the gap between them. },

In this study, we analyse a large mobile phone dataset to explore the way life history influences human sociality and the way social networks are structured. Our results indicate that these aspects of human behaviour are strongly related to age and gender such that younger individuals have more contacts and, among them, males more than females. However, the rate of decrease in the number of contacts with age differs between males and females, such that there is a reversal in the number of contacts around the late 30s. We suggest that this pattern can be attributed to the difference in reproductive investments that are made by the two sexes. We analyse the inequality in social investment patterns and suggest that the age- and gender-related differences we find reflect the constraints imposed by reproduction in a context where time (a form of social capital) is limited.},

Model-based methods such as maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm and multiple imputation hold more promise for dealing with difficulties caused by missing data. While model-based methods require specialized computer programs and assumptions about the nature of the missing data, these methods are appropriate for a wider range of situations than the more commonly used ad hoc methods.

In estimations that control for the effects of individual characteristics at different points of the distribution, they calculate the part of the gap attributable to differing returns between men and women. The magnitude of the gender pay gap, thus measured, varied substantially across countries and across the public and private sector wage distributions. The gap typically widened toward the top of the wage distribution (the ``glass ceiling'' effect), and in a few cases it also widened at the bottom (the ``sticky floor'' effect). The authors suggest that differences in childcare provision and wage setting institutions across EU countries may partly account for the variation in patterns by country and sector. },

Although rarely engaging in strategies to avoid being academically labeled, students engaged in strategies to avoid labeling in other domains.

Critically, the approach can identify if and when people invoke noncompensatory screeners that eliminate large swaths of alternatives from detailed consideration. The model is estimated using deidentified activity data on 1.1 million browsing and writing decisions observed on an online dating site. We find that mate seekers enact screeners (``deal breakers'') that encode acceptability cutoffs. A nonparametric account of heterogeneity reveals that, even after controlling for a host of observable attributes, mate evaluation differs across decision stages as well as across identified groupings of men and women.

The review is orientated towards researchers who undertake secondary analyses of large-scale micro-level social science datasets. The article begins with an outline of important context, which impinges upon the measurement of education. The United Kingdom is the focus of this review, but similar issues apply to other nation states. We provide a critical introduction to the main approaches to measuring education in social survey research, which include measuring years of education, using categorical qualification based measures and scaling approaches. We advocate the use of established education measures to better facilitate comparability and replication. We conclude by making the recommendation that researchers place careful thought into which educational measure they select, and that researchers should routinely engage in appropriate sensitivity analyses. },

@article{Banerjee2013,
	Abstract = {Introduction How do the network positions of the first individuals in a society to receive information about a new product affect its eventual diffusion? To answer this question, we develop a model of information diffusion through a social network that discriminates between information passing (individuals must be aware of the product before they can adopt it, and they can learn from their friends) and endorsement (the decisions of informed individuals to adopt the product might be influenced by their friends{\textquoteright} decisions). We apply it to the diffusion of microfinance loans, in a setting where the set of potentially first-informed individuals is known. We then propose two new measures of how {\textquotedblleft}central{\textquotedblright} individuals are in their social network with regard to spreading information; the centrality of the first-informed individuals in a village helps significantly in predicting eventual adoption. Diffusion of information and participation. (Left) First-informed households have decided whether to participate and stochastically pass on information to their neighbors. (Right) Participation may affect the probability of passing information. Newly informed nodes make their decisions, possibly being influenced by the decisions of their neighbors. After newly informed nodes make their participation decisions, all informed nodes engage in another round of stochastic communication. Methods Six months before a microfinance institution entered 43 villages in India and began offering microfinance loans to villagers, we collected detailed network data by surveying households about a wide range of interactions. The microfinance institution began by inviting {\textquotedblleft}leaders{\textquotedblright} (e.g., teachers, shopkeepers, savings group leaders) to an informational meeting and then asked them to spread information about the loans. Using the network data, the locations in the network of these first-informed villagers (or injection points), and data regarding the villagers{\textquoteright} subsequent participation, we estimate the parameters of our diffusion model using the method of simulated moments. The parameters of the model are validated by showing that the model correctly predicts the evolution of participation in each village over time. The model yields a new measure of the effectiveness of any given node as an injection point, which we call communication centrality. Finally, we develop an easily computed proxy for communication centrality, which we call diffusion centrality. Results We find that a microfinance participant is seven times as likely to inform another household as a nonparticipant; nonetheless, information transmitted by nonparticipants is important and accounts for about one-third of the eventual informedness and participation in the village because nonparticipants are much more numerous. Once information passing is accounted for, an informed household{\textquoteright}s decision to participate is not significantly dependent on how many of its neighbors have participated. Communication centrality, when applied to the set of first-informed individuals in a village, substantially outperforms other standard network measures of centrality in predicting microfinance participation in this context. Finally, the simpler proxy measure{\textemdash}diffusion centrality{\textemdash}is strongly correlated with communication centrality and inherits its predictive properties. Discussion Our results suggest that a model of diffusion can distinguish information passing from endorsement effects, and that understanding the nature of transmission may be important in identifying the ideal places to inject information. Much of the recent work on how individuals in social networks behave has relied upon the established Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered model developed in epidemiology. Information, however, differs from disease in one respect, namely that an individual might acquire information and yet not use it (or become {\textquotedblleft}infected{\textquotedblright} by it). Banerjee et al. (1236498) examined the spread of information about microfinance and its adoption in 43 villages in Karnataka, a state in southern India. Adopters of microfinance were more likely to pass information about it on, and a new measure{\textemdash}diffusion centrality{\textemdash}of the first person to learn new information predicted how widely and quickly others would be likely to make use of it. To study the impact of the choice of injection points in the diffusion of a new product in a society, we developed a model of word-of-mouth diffusion and then applied it to data on social networks and participation in a newly available microfinance loan program in 43 Indian villages. Our model allows us to distinguish information passing among neighbors from direct influence of neighbors{\textquoteright} participation decisions, as well as information passing by participants versus nonparticipants. The model estimates suggest that participants are seven times as likely to pass information compared to informed nonparticipants, but information passed by nonparticipants still accounts for roughly one-third of eventual participation. An informed household is not more likely to participate if its informed friends participate. We then propose two new measures of how effective a given household would be as an injection point. We show that the centrality of the injection points according to these measures constitutes a strong and significant predictor of eventual village-level participation.},

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.},

This quantitative conception of social structure is the basis for a deductive theory of the macrostructure of social associations in society. The likelihood that people engage in intergroup associations under specifiable structural conditions can bededuced from analaytic propositions about structural properties without any assumption about sociopsychological dispositions to establish intergroup associations, indeed, on the assumption that people prefer ingroup relations. Group size governs the probability of intergroup relations, a fact that has paradoxical implications for discrimination by a majority against a minority. Inequality impedes and heterogeneity promotes intergroup relations. The major structural condition that governs intergroup relations is the degree of connection of parameters. Intersecting parameters exert structural constraints to participate in intergroup relations; consolidated parameters impede them. The more differentiation of any kind penetrates into the substructures of society, the greater is the probability that extensive social relations integrate various segments in society.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Network homophily is a pattern in which ties are more likely to exist between nodes similar to each other. It is frequently observed for various types of social relations. At the same time, segregation is often encountered in urban areas as a tendency of families to occupy neighborhoods inhabited by other families similar to them. In this paper we conceptualize both phenomena as in the language of networks of interlinked positions occupied by a population of actors characterized by some node-level attribute. We review existing indexes and approaches to measuring the extent of homophily/segregation in social networks. We pursue an approach of, first, specifying a set of properties that a generic segregation measure might possess, and which, in our view, are relevant in substantial contexts. Second, we check which measures satisfy which properties. The use of measures is illustrated with four empirical examples. Given the particular application and the need for some descriptive measure of segregation, the results presented in this paper can help in selecting an optimal measure for the task at hand. We conclude that the most crucial aspects for the choice of a particular segregation measure include (1) whether the network ties or actors' attributes are assumed to be subject to change, and (2) how one should treat the presence of network isolates. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we explore the potential implications of geographical variability for the structure of social networks. Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the ``social fabric'' that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved.},

We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins' interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network--religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish.

Individuals have types and see type-dependent benefits from friendships. We examine the properties of a steady-state equilibrium of a matching process of friendship formation. We use the model to understand three empirical patterns of friendship formation: (i) larger groups tend to form more same-type ties and fewer other-type ties than small groups, (ii) larger groups form more ties per capita, and (iii) all groups are biased towards same-type relative to demographics, with the most extreme bias coming from middle-sized groups. We show how these empirical observations can be generated by biases in preferences and biases in meetings. We also illustrate some welfare implications of the model.},
	Annote = {The authors define measures of homophily in the first section and discuss an utility-function-based friendship formation process in the following sections.

In particular, they define the homophily index of group $i$ as
$$
H_i = \frac{s_i}{s_i + d_i},
$$
where $s_i$ is the average number of connections a node of type $i$ has with nodes of the same type and $d_i$ is the average number of connetions a node of type $i$ has with nodes of a different type.

They define the inbreeding homophily index of group $i$ as
$$
IH_i = \frac{H_i-w_i}{1-w_i},
$$
where $w_i$ is the fraction of the population that is of type $i$. If there is only baseline homophily, i.e. $H_i=w_i$, $IH_i=0$. If all connections are with the same type, $IH_i=1$. If there are no connections with the same type, $IH=-\frac{w_i}{1-w_i}$--the index does not have a particularly nice normalisation.

Having explored the data from the AddHealth survey, they develop an economic (utility-maximising) theory of friendship formation and fit it to the data using standard grid search. Their model has two stages at which inequality in friendships can be created: The mixing process can be biases (e.g. we might meet more same-type people in our daily lives) and the preferences can be biased (even if we meet different-type people at the same rate as same-type we might still choose to associate with same-type people). The former leads to smaller groups being more inbred (under their specific assumption) and the latter leads to larger groups being more inbred.

They claim that larger groups have a larger number of friendships--which is contradiction with the observations we have made in the context of Wang's data on mobile phone networks.

They consider welfare in the context of maximising the utility function (for each group or for the whole population on average).

Extracting patterns and regularities from the resulting massive amount of human mobility data requires the development of appropriate tools for uncovering information in spatially embedded networks. In contrast with most works that tend to apply standard network metrics to any type of network, we argue in this paper for a careful treatment of the constraints imposed by space on network topology. In particular, we focus on the problem of community detection and propose a modularity function adapted to spatial networks. We show that it is possible to factor out the effect of space in order to reveal more clearly hidden structural similarities between the nodes. Methods are tested on a large mobile phone network and computer-generated benchmarks where the effect of space has been incorporated.},

These interactions generate fine-grained time-stamped records of human behavior and social interaction at the level of individual events, yet are global in scale, allowing researchers to address fundamental questions about social identity, status, conflict, cooperation, collective action, and diffusion, both by using observational data and by conducting in vivo field experiments. This unprecedented opportunity comes with a number of methodological challenges, including generalizing observations to the offline world, protecting individual privacy, and solving the logistical challenges posed by ``big data'' and web-based experiments. We review current advances in online social research and critically assess the theoretical and methodological opportunities and limitations.

This project adopts a case study approach and simultaneously tests for propinquity and homophily effects on neighborhood ties by employing a full-network sample from a recently developed New Urbanist neighborhood within a mid-sized southern city. The authors find that physical distance reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the like- lihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers---age, marital status, and the presence of children---reduces the formation of weak ties. Consis- tent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties. An important innovation is this study's ability to directly compare the effects of physical distance and social distance, placing them into equivalent units: a 10 percent increase in home value difference is equivalent to a 5.6 percent increase in physical distance.},

	Abstract = { Network models are widely used to represent relational information among interacting units. In studies of social networks, recent emphasis has been placed on random graph models where the nodes usually represent individual social actors and the edges represent the presence of a specified relation between actors. We develop a class of models where the probability of a relation between actors depends on the positions of individuals in an unobserved ``social space.'' We make inference for the social space within maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and propose Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for making inference on latent positions and the effects of observed covariates. We present analyses of three standard datasets from the social networks literature, and compare the method to an alternative stochastic blockmodeling approach. In addition to improving on model fit for these datasets, our method provides a visual and interpretable model-based spatial representation of social relationships and improves on existing methods by allowing the statistical uncertainty in the social space to be quantified and graphically represented. },

The main aim of the paper is to embed the network in a lower-dimensional space--which isn't connected to any real-world attributes associated with the nodes.

They apply the data to three different networks and show that they can be embedded in a space of much lower dimensions than the original adjacency matrix.

They note that the model can easily deal with missing data because the likelihood only depends on observed ties. This appears dubious because their log-likelihood (Eq. (4)) has a constant term in the sum over all dyads. I.e. the log-likelihood will depends on the total number of absent ties.},

Contextual explanations for individual behavior argue that (1) individual preferences and actions are influenced through social interaction, and (2) social interaction is structured by the social composition of the individual's environment. Thus, a preliminary step to constructing contextual theories of individual behavior is an examination of the way that the social context structures social encounters and friendship choice. The empirical correspondence between the content of neighborhood social contexts and the content of social networks is examined using a sample of white male Detroit residents. A mathematical model of associational choice is developed that incorporates the ability of individuals to enforce social preferences on their choice of friends while it maintains the role of the social context in structuring that choice.},

	Abstract = {This article addresses the role of spatial interaction in social networks. We analyse empirical data describing a network of leisure contacts and show that the probability to accept a person as a contact scales in distance with ~ d                {\thinspace}~{\thinspace}1.4. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the number of contacts an individual possesses is independent from its spatial location and the spatial distribution of opportunities. This means that individuals living in areas with a low accessibility to other persons (rural areas) exhibit at average the same number of contacts compared to individuals living in areas with high accessibility (urban areas). Low accessibility is thus compensated with a higher background probability to accept other candidates as social contacts. In addition, we propose a model for large-scale social networks involving a spatial and social interaction between individuals. Simulation studies are conducted using a synthetic population based on census data as input. The results show that the model is capable of reproducing the spatial structure, but, however, fails to reproduce other topological characteristics. Both, the analysis of empirical data and the simulation results provide a further evidence that spatial interaction is a crucial aspect of social networks. Yet, it appears that spatial proximity does only explain the spatial structure of a network but has no significant impact on its topology.},

Data analysis included a discriminant analysis to distinguish the three groups and the content analysis of an open-ended question about attraction. Being perceived as polite and friendly and having similar values, interests, and background were found to be very influential predictors of friendship. Residential proximity and working together showed very modest relationships to friendship. Physical appearance was not at all related to friendship.

We apply this issue to the question of whether there is selection in networks based on age on the one hand, and marital status on the other hand. The role of age has been documented before, but selection on the basis of marital status has not been documented. We analyze a representative survey containing data on contact and support networks. We use a novel analytical approach by adopting a latent class type random-effects approach to the multilevel structure of the network data which allows for simple descriptions of homogeneity in terms of odds ratio's. Our analyses show that age boundaries are strong and that they partly explain marital status boundaries. Nevertheless, even after controlling for age, we see important social boundaries between marital status groups.

@article{Kim2012,
	Abstract = { Abstract Networks are a powerful way to describe and represent social, technological, and biological systems, where nodes represent entities (people, web sites, genes) and edges represent interactions (friendships, communication, regulation). The study of such networks then seeks to find common structural patterns and explain their emergence through tractable models of network formation. In most networks, each node is associated with a rich set of attributes or features. For example, users in online social networks have profile information, genes have properties and functions, and web pages contain text. However, most existing network models focus on modeling the network structure while ignoring the features and properties of the nodes. Thus, the questions that we address in this work are as follows: What is a mathematically tractable model that naturally captures ways in which the network structure and node attributes interact? What are the properties of networks that arise under such a model? We present a model of network structure that we refer to as the multiplicative attribute graphs (MAG) model. The MAG model naturally captures the interactions between the network structure and the node attributes. We consider a model in which each node has a vector of categorical attributes associated with it. The link-affinity matrix then models the interaction between the value of a particular attribute and the probability of a link between a pair of nodes. The MAG model yields itself to mathematical analysis, and we derive thresholds for the connectivity and the emergence of the giant connected component, and show that the model gives rise to networks with a constant diameter. We also analyze the degree distribution and find surprising flexibility of the MAG model in that it can generate networks with either log-normal or power-law degree distribution. },

	Abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ("nonevents"). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all availables events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k-5 and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases as d-2, where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {The uneven distribution of wealth and individual economic capacities are among the main forces, which shape modern societies and arguably bias the emerging social structures. However, the study of correlations between the social network and economic status of individuals is difficult due to the lack of large-scale multimodal data disclosing both the social ties and economic indicators of the same population. Here, we close this gap through the analysis of coupled datasets recording the mobile phone communications and bank transaction history of one million anonymized individuals living in a Latin American country. We show that wealth and debt are unevenly distributed among people in agreement with the Pareto principle; the observed social structure is strongly stratified, with people being better connected to others of their own socioeconomic class rather than to others of different classes; the social network appears to have assortative socioeconomic correlations and tightly connected {\textquoteleft}rich clubs{\textquoteright}; and that individuals from the same class live closer to each other but commute further if they are wealthier. These results are based on a representative, society-large population, and empirically demonstrate some long-lasting hypotheses on socioeconomic correlations, which potentially lay behind social segregation, and induce differences in human mobility.},

We follow Peter Blau, Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin, Duncan Watts and many others in positing that human behavior is best understood in terms of the complex social systems within which actions are taken, and that the representation of these social systems must make evident the endogenous structural constraints on opportunities for interpersonal contact and group affiliation. We further demonstrate that the ability to seed social simulations with representative social data about the society being modeled (e.g. from social surveys), and the use of social networks generated using principles of homophily from empirical social science, provide a compelling and actionable framework for both interpreting with and theory building from whole society simulations. },

	Abstract = {Analyses of egocentric networks make the implicit assumption that the list of alters elicited by name generators is a complete list or representative sample of relevant alters. Based on the literature on free recall tasks and the organization of people in memory, I hypothesize that respondents presented with a name generator are more likely to name alters with whom they share stronger ties, alters who are more connected within the network, and alters with whom they interact in more settings. I conduct a survey that presents respondents with the \{GSS\} name generator and then prompts them to remember other relevant alters whom they have not yet listed. By comparing the alters elicited before and after prompts I find support for the first two hypotheses. I then go on to compare network-level measures calculated with the alters elicited by the name generator to the same measures calculated with data from all alters. These measures are not well correlated. Furthermore, the degree of underestimation of network size is related to the networks' mean closeness, density, and mean duration of relationships. Higher values on these variables result in more accurate estimation of network size. This suggests that measures of egocentric network properties based on data collected using a single name generator may have high levels of measurement error, possibly resulting in misestimation of how these network properties relate to other variables. },

	Abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle-the homophily principle-structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

These include 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Sex and Gender', 'Age', 'Religion', 'Education, Occupation and Social Class', 'Network Position', 'Behaviour' and 'Attitudes, Abilities, Beliefs and Aspirations'.

Furthermore, they discuss underlying factors that can lead to homophily such as 'Geography', 'Family Ties', 'Organisational Foci', 'Occupational, Family and Informal Roles', 'Cognitive Processes'.

They consider cognitive processes that lead to 'inbred homophily' rather than 'baseline homophily'. 'Baseline homophily' arises amongst the majority group because their likelyhood to exposure to the minority is small. 'Inbred homophily' is a consequence of an effort of a group to socialise predominantly amongst themselves. In particular, they consider 'Selective Tie Dissolution'.

Finally, they provide an outlook towards future research and recommend the investigation of multiplex networks (i.e. social connections with multiple functions), an investigation of the dynamics of network formation and an investigation of the interaction amongst the feedback between network and the opportunity to meet people.

	Abstract = {Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in the past two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey (GSS) collected the first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors replicated those questions to assess social change in core network structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates, but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in America.},

One possible solution to both of these problems is to use synthetically generated data. However, this presents a series of challenges related to generating a realistic dataset in terms of topologies, attribute values, communities, data distributions, correlations and so on. In the following work, we present and validate an approach for populating a graph topology with synthetic data which approximates an online social network. The empirical tests confirm that our approach generates a dataset which is both diverse and with a good fit to the target requirements, with a realistic modeling of noise and fitting to communities. A good match is obtained between the generated data and the target profiles and distributions, which is competitive with other state of the art methods. The data generator is also highly configurable, with a sophisticated control parameter set for different ``similarity/diversity'' levels.},

	Abstract = {The principle that `popularity is attractive' underlies preferential attachment, which is a common explanation for the emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws, as observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication. Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity. We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.},

(1) A new node is added at each time step $t$ and is assigned a random angle $\theta_t \in [0,2\pi]$.
(2) The node connects to the $m$ existing nodes born at times $s$ such that $s\left|\theta_s-\theta_t|$ is minimised, i.e. the product of similarity in angular and radial space is minimised.

This model has preferential attachment features because nodes that were added earlier receive more connections. However, other metrics such as clustering generated by the model are closer to real-world networks than preferential attachment.

They introduce modifications to the model which allows them to vary the power-law exponent of the degree distribution.},

In particular, the effect of clustering on outbreak probabilities is strongest when the vaccination coverage is close to the level required to provide herd immunity under the assumption of random mixing.

We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions---sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education---changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries.},

	Abstract = { Network sampling poses a radical idea: that it is possible to measure global network structure without the full population coverage assumed in most network studies. Network sampling is only useful, however, if a researcher can produce accurate global network estimates. This article explores the practicality of making network inference, focusing on the approach introduced in Smith (2012). The method uses sampled ego network data and simulation techniques to make inference about the global features of the true, unknown network. The validity check here includes more difficult scenarios than previous tests, including those that go beyond the initial scope conditions of the method. I examine networks with a skewed degree distribution and surveys that limit the number of social ties a respondent can list. For each network/survey combination, I take a random ego network sample, run the simulation method, and compare the results to the true values (using measures of connectivity and cohesion). I also test the method on local measures of network structure. The results, on the whole, are encouraging. The method produces good estimates even in cases where the degree distribution is skewed and the survey is strongly restricted. I also find that is it better to not truncate the survey if possible. If the survey must be restricted, the researcher would do well to infer the missing data, rather than use the raw data naively. },

@article{Smith2017a,
	Abstract = { Where do individuals identifying as Hispanic fit in the racial landscape of the United States? The answer offered by past work is complex: The empirical results do not lend themselves to simple interpretation as no single hypothesis fits the Hispanic case very well. Instead, Hispanic integration is described as mixtures of different archetypical hypotheses, like panethnic formation, white assimilation, and racialized assimilation. My goal is to develop a formal framework to help make sense of this complex picture. I extend past work by showing which combination of integration processes (panethnic formation, white assimilation, etc.) best characterizes Hispanic marriage patterns. I make two analytical contributions. First, I organize past Hispanic hypotheses, both archetypical and blended, into a single theoretical framework defined by the salience of race and Hispanic ethnicity. Second, I parametize this theoretical framework using latent social space models. In this way, I am able to specify a set of interconnected, complex hypotheses in a tractable manner. I follow past work and use marriage/cohabitation data to test the hypotheses. Using American Community Survey data (2010--2012), I find that Hispanic marriage/cohabitation patterns suggest high salience on both race and Hispanic ethnicity. Thus, categories like black-Mexican or white-Cuban represent relationally distinct social categories---distinct from both non-Hispanic racial categories (e.g., black or white) and Hispanic categories of a different racial identity. },

@article{Snijders2011,
	Abstract = { Statistical models for social networks as dependent variables must represent the typical network dependencies between tie variables such as reciprocity, homophily, transitivity, etc. This review first treats models for single (cross-sectionally observed) networks and then for network dynamics. For single networks, the older literature concentrated on conditionally uniform models. Various types of latent space models have been developed: for discrete, general metric, ultrametric, Euclidean, and partially ordered spaces. Exponential random graph models were proposed long ago but now are applied more and more thanks to the non-Markovian social circuit specifications that were recently proposed. Modeling network dynamics is less complicated than modeling single network observations because dependencies are spread out in time. For modeling network dynamics, continuous-time models are more fruitful. Actor-oriented models here provide a model that can represent many dependencies in a flexible way. Strong model development is now going on to combine the features of these models and to extend them to more complicated outcome spaces. },

	Abstract = {Background Little quantitative information is available on the mixing patterns of children in school environments. Describing and understanding contacts between children at school would help quantify the transmission opportunities of respiratory infections and identify situations within schools where the risk of transmission is higher. We report on measurements carried out in a French school (6--12 years children), where we collected data on the time-resolved face-to-face proximity of children and teachers using a proximity-sensing infrastructure based on radio frequency identification devices.   Methods and Findings Data on face-to-face interactions were collected on Thursday, October 1st and Friday, October 2nd 2009. We recorded 77,602 contact events between 242 individuals (232 children and 10 teachers). In this setting, each child has on average 323 contacts per day with 47 other children, leading to an average daily interaction time of 176 minutes. Most contacts are brief, but long contacts are also observed. Contacts occur mostly within each class, and each child spends on average three times more time in contact with classmates than with children of other classes. We describe the temporal evolution of the contact network and the trajectories followed by the children in the school, which constrain the contact patterns. We determine an exposure matrix aimed at informing mathematical models. This matrix exhibits a class and age structure which is very different from the homogeneous mixing hypothesis.   Conclusions We report on important properties of the contact patterns between school children that are relevant for modeling the propagation of diseases and for evaluating control measures. We discuss public health implications related to the management of schools in case of epidemics and pandemics. Our results can help define a prioritization of control measures based on preventive measures, case isolation, classes and school closures, that could reduce the disruption to education during epidemics.},

	Abstract = {Homophily refers to the phenomenon where people who are socially-connected share many characteristics including demographic and behavioral properties. The goal of this paper is to see whether homophily exists in call networks and if so, to what degree we can infer a cellphone user's demographic properties by knowing the demographic information of the people that s/he talks to. We focus on three types of demographic information: a) home location, b) age group, and c) income level. The novelty is two-folds. First, we use both communication metrics and structural properties of call graphs to identify those ``important'' friends for each user with whom (s)he is most likely to be in homophily. Second, we assess the importance of different time slices such as weekdays, or nights and weekends for capturing different user relationships. We conduct our study on a real data trace with 20M subscribers during one month from a nationwide cellular carrier. Our first contribution is that we quantify the extent of homophily on the call graph and identify the correlations between homophily and communication and structural features. As a second contribution, we develop effective methods to infer demographic information for a cellular user using linear regression to select the most homophily-like friend of her/him. We find that we can predict home location within 20km radius with 80\% accuracy, and age group and income level with 78\% and 72\% accuracy, respectively.},

@article{Wimmer2010,
	Abstract = {A notable feature of U.S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily---the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from ``elite'' backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.},
